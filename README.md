# Human-vs-Machine

We're doing a lab: human-vs-machine.
Pick any of these 3 groups:

* Slave of the machine: Forced AI assisted
* Human in control: Limited AI assistance
* Cooperation: AI+Human

## Preparation:

* Setup a project in your favorite language with unit tests.

## Goal of the hands-on:

Learn, evaluate and discuss advantages and disadvantages of using AI for coding

## Rules for the groups

All the groups have to implement the KATA.md

### Slave of the Machine: Forced AI assisted

You are not allowed to write any code at all, only instructions to the LLM.
The LLM should implement all the code.

Note, you are allowed to write code examples as instructions to the LLM.

### Human in control: Limited AI assistance

You are allowed to use an LLM, but can only interact with it through copy-paste and can only use it for:

* scaffolding - for examples setting up something to start quickly
* transforming the tests from the README to code

### Cooperation: AI+Human 

You can use AI however you want, but try to use it as much as possible.
